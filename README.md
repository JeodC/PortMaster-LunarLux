## Installation
Use `download_depot 1932680 1932681 4860005663388923912` with Steam Console to download the game and add the data to `lunarlux/assets`.

If you have a powerful device you can try using the latest game assets, simply modify `lunarlux/tools/patchscript` in a text editor to bypass the xdelta and rename your `data.win` to `game.droid` manually.

This port swaps abxy controls to match the ingame button prompts. If your device does not match, delete the `swapabxy.txt` file in the `lunarlux` folder.
